	<p>I have been thinking on the concept of Small Data after a talk I heard in Stockholm a few weeks ago.
Small Data contrasts the usual "Big Data", i.e. the huge datasets used by AI companies and many developers and researchers. 
</p>
<p>The recent trend in making bigger and bigger models has brought us exceptional results, e.g. ChatGTP, or Suno and Udio; however this comes at a cost that is payed in terms of the ethics surrounding how data is harvested and used.
By definition, "Big Data" is <i>numerically</i> big: we are talking about anything from ten thousands to millions (or maybe even more) of data points; this because deep learning models need lots of that in order to generalise properly. The advantages of generalisation are clear: the model can adapt to different contexts, it can get rid of noise, it can apply patterns to unknown examples. However, this also means that the model fails on out-of-distribution samples, which might actually be the ones where we would want the model to help us out. When considering fields like music and art, things become even more complicated.
</p>
<p>
One common feature of generative models for music is that, past the novelty factor, everything sounds more or less the same. Sure, systems like Suno and Udio can produce radically different styles of music, but, somehow, everything has the same patina on top. Most importantly, a lot of times these models seem to be able to reproduce many styles faithfully, but what they are really doing is giving us an average representation of how a certain kind of music sounds, without any of the specific things that make it that kind of music. Try to generate "flamenco" on Suno, and you will obtain something vaguely Spanish sounding, acoustic guitars, <i>palmas</i>, and so on, but <b>not</b> flamenco. Most notably, the vocals are usually in English, which is maybe the stupidest thing to get wrong in this case.
</p>
<p>
	The solution then would be small data: after all, the master's of a musical tradition themselves are <i>small data models</i>, because none of them has listened to and learned millions of songs to get to where they are. They get there because they have richer data and learn from it more efficiently.
How can a small dataset be richer than a big one? Less is more, but in the end, more is more.
